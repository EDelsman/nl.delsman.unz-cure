### Add Z-wave devices unsecure

There are several reasons why you may not want to include your Z-wave devices with the security level Homey picks. One reason is that you might want to create an association with a device that has another security level. Or you may have a device that just won't pair with Homey, even from up close to Homey. Or your device response times are really, really slow. Often unsecure inclusion can help solve these issues. Ans as long as the device isn't for example a front door lock, unsecure may well be secure enough for you.

If your device ask for a pin during inclusion, you can just enter 00000 as the pin and the inclusion will be unsecure. If it does not, or if pairing just won't succeed no mattr what you try, this app may help. 

First make sure you have the proper app for your z-wave device istalled on your Homey. That is because you still need the real driver to operate the device. But here's the trick. When adding the device to Homey, pick UnZ-Cure as the device to pair, instead of the z-wave device it actually is. Don't worry: Homey will still add the device as the right type, from the right app. The UnZ-cure will just add a parameter to prevent z-wave secure inclusion.
